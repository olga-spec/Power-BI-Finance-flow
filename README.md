# Power-BI-Finance-flow
This project is aimed at creating dashboards for money flow analysis.

Practical Assignment

1. Review the data in the Financial Flows dataset.
2. For a better understanding of the metrics, review the glossary.
3. Build a dashboard that reflects key retail sales indicators:
● Key indicators: Inflows, Outflows, Avg. inflow amount, Avg. outflow amount. Currencies should be preserved, and amounts formatted.
● Structure of the "Net Flow"
● Waterfall chart showing the dynamics over the years (displaying the "Net Flow" metric)
● Monthly dynamics of inflows, outflows, and "Net Flow". Implement chart switching via buttons.
● Comparative detailed matrix by types of funds, with drill-down to the account level. Display the volumes of inflows, outflows, and "Net Flow."

4. Demonstrate skills in: 
● Designing a prototype, using UX/UI principles 
● Selecting and appropriately formatting charts 
● Using scalar DAX (including iterative) and tabular DAX expressions 
● Data modeling and relationship management

5. Ensure your dashboard reflects: 
● Key indicators: Inflows, Outflows, Avg. inflow amount, Avg. outflow amount. Currencies preserved, amounts formatted. 
● Structure of the "Net Flow" 
● Waterfall chart showing the dynamics over the years (displaying the "Net Flow" metric) 
● Monthly dynamics of inflows, outflows, and "Net Flow", with chart switching via buttons. 
● Comparative detailed matrix by types of funds, with drill-down to the account level, displaying the volumes of inflows, outflows, and "Net Flow."
